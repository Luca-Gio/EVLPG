This is an open-source Python-based module focused on simulating the integration of electric vehicles in a low voltage grid. The goal of this module is to investigate on possible effects that the integration of electric vehicles could cause on the operability of the power network. The conditions of the electric grid are estimated by analyzing line loading, voltage values at the final customer, and the loading of transformers connected to main substations. The following tool enables modeling electric grids composed of basic grid elements such as lines, two-winding transformers, and loads. Moreover, it generates electric vehicle load profiles based on a statistical approach. Subsequently, these load profiles are distributed across the electric grid. Besides, it performs time-series simulations through a secondary software named OpenDSS. Results are then exported to be easily analyzed. Furthermore, the module is provided with a graphical user interface. This module is easy to use, but initial conditions must be defined to perform simulations.
